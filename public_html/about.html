            I started working at ICA back in 2006. Here I worked with most
            things, anything from leadership, to improvmentworks. But I started
            as most people, driving truck and picked food for stores. I did
            start my work in -28, it was pretty cold!!

            Back in 2012 I did do CAD Construction, but I chose to end this bit
            early, I did half of it. Why? Because I got my first child in 2013.
            This made me focus on family and I returned to ICA. But I wanted to
            improve so I got some office work, transport planning for the area I
            was in. Aswell as protection agent.

            We moved outside Gothenburg and bought a house, where we soon got
            our second child. So work was just part of everyday life. While
            family was growing I was part of the game community, and did
            volenteer work. I was head of the volenteers during the big
            convention Gothcon.

            Forward to 2017 and I founded the gameclub Ale Konfliktspel. This
            was to create a safe space for my kids and others, a meeting place
            for gamers. Its a club that welcomes anyone and focues the analog
            games, and the hobby around it. In the end of 2017 we where 18
            members, and in the end of 2023 we grown to 74 members!

            During this time I did also found a company Polarbear Trading
            Company HB, it was just an online retailer for game components. I
            did it as a fun test and a service for the gaming community around
            Gothenburg, but I did chose to end it back in 2019
